Description:
In this module, we use a probable prime test that states the following:

    For a natural number n > 2, if 2^(n-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod n), then n is very likely prime.

Since this is a probable prime test, we cannot be certain we are finding a prime number unless we use a prime
test such as Wilson's Theorem in the primes.py.However, there is a 99.9999996% chance of finding a prime.

I have yet to see a non-prime number returned. Although, inevitably we will be counting non-primes as primes,
so if you ask for the 100th prime, which is 541, you will instead get 523.
